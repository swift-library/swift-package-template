<!--
Thanks for contributing to the Swift <#swift-package-name#>!

Before you submit your issue, please replace each paragraph
below with the relevant details for your bug, and complete
the steps in the checklist by placing an 'x' in each box:

- [x] I've completed this task
- [ ] This task isn't completed
-->

Replace this paragraph with a short description of the incorrect incorrect behavior. If this is a regression, please note the last version that the behavior was correct in addition to your current version.

### Description
<!-- Describe clearly and concisely what the bug is. -->

### Checklist
- [ ] If possible, I've reproduced the issue using the `main` branch of this package
- [ ] I've searched for [existing GitHub issues](https://github.com/swift-library/<#swift-package#>/issues)

### Steps to Reproduce
<!--
Explain how to reproduce the problem (in steps if seen fit) and include either
an inline test case (preferred) or a project that reproduces it. Consider
reducing the sample to the smallest amount of code possible — a smaller test
case is easier to reason about and more appealing to сontributors.
-->

Replace this paragraph with an explanation of how to reproduce the incorrect behavior. This could include a code listing for a reduced version of your command, or a link to the code that is exhibiting the issue.

### Expected behavior
<!-- Describe what you expected to happen. -->

<!-- If deemed helpful, add screenshots that showcase the problem. -->
<!-- **Screenshots** -->

<!--
Include information about the Swift compiler version and, if applicable, the
Xcode version you are observing the problem in and the deployment target.
-->

### Actual behavior
Describe or copy/paste the behavior you observe.

### Environment
- Swift compiler version info <!-- replace with the output of 'swiftc -version' -->
- Xcode version info <!-- replace with the output of 'xcodebuild -version' -->
- Deployment target: <!-- e.g. iOS 12.3 -->
- **Swift <#swift-package-name#> version:** `0.0.1` or the `main` branch, for example.

<!-- Add any other context about the problem as appropriate. -->
